# My Store

This project is a simple simulation of a shopping app using Angular CLI. This Single Page Application ( SPA ) adapts well to both mobile and larger screens.

## Usage

My store allows users to add items to their shopping cart from the home page ( Best Selling ) or from the main products page. The shopping cart can be modified by deleting an order or changing the order quantity before checking out and you will be shown a success page after completing the checkout form. Explore. Happy Shopping!
